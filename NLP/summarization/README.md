Here we have a set of summarization algorithms that we have implemented. Here we show for each of them how they 
perform under various conditions.

Think of long texts, short text, misspelled text, etc. But also, is the model language agnostic or not?

What we have here are three pieces of text: a news article, an imbd movie review, and a tweet.

- news article: "NEW DELHI: The Dalai Lama has spoken out for the first time about the Rohingya refugee crisis, saying 
Buddha would have helped Muslims fleeing violence in Buddhist-majority Myanmar. \
 Hundreds of thousands of Rohingya have arrived in Bangladesh in recent weeks after violence flared in neighbouring Myanmar, where the stateless Muslim minority has endured decades of persecution. \
 The top Buddhist leader is the latest Nobel peace laureate to speak out against the violence, which the UN special rapporteur on human rights in Myanmar says may have killed more than 1,000 people, most of them Rohingya. \
 "Those people who are sort of harassing some Muslims, they should remember Buddha," the Dalai Lama told journalists who asked him about the crisis on Friday (Sep 8) evening. \
 'He would definitely give help to those poor Muslims. So still I feel that. So very sad.' \
 Myanmars population is overwhelmingly Buddhist and there is widespread hatred for the Rohingya, who are denied citizenship and labelled illegal 'Bengali' immigrants. \
 Buddhist nationalists, led by firebrand monks, have operated a long Islamophobic campaign calling for them to be pushed out of the country. \
 Myanmars de facto civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi has been condemned for her refusal to intervene in support of the Rohingya, including by fellow Nobel laureates Malala Yousafzai and Desmond Tutu. \
 Archbishop Tutu, who became the moral voice of South Africa after helping dismantle apartheid there, last week urged her to speak out. \
 'If the political price of your ascension to the highest office in Myanmar is your silence, the price is surely too steep,' Tutu said in a statement."
 
- movie review: "As usual, the critics fail to grasp the obvious. Does the movie entertain? Yes, it does. Absolutely. Sure, it may not match the real story, and many things are not based in reality, but that's the point! It's a movie! It is a fun musical, very well done and enjoyable.If it was a made up story about John G. Pigglestack, then the critics would have nothing to complain about. I actually likes this much better than La La Land. Guess it's more upbeat. Musicals are a rare breed. Enjoy them while you can."

- tweet: "Bad ratings @CNN & @MSNBC got scammed when they covered the anti-Trump Russia rally wall-to-wall. They probably knew it was Fake News but, because it was a rally against me, they pushed it hard anyway. Two really dishonest newscasters, but the public is wise!"
